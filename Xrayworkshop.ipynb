In ds9, you can move around and click on the buttons with your mouse. You then look for the obvious brihgt source and look up the \"physical coordinates\" (= the pixels on the camera). In this case, the source is at 4096, 4088.5, so we put that in the `infile` parameter below with a radius of 2 pixels. Then, we look for a region with no sources, where we can measure the background. We want a big region (so we get a good statistical sample). I selected a circle centered on 3700, 4200, with a radius of 300. \n",
